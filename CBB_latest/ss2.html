        <span class="item2center">Are you a UC Davis undergraduate committed to the goal of <strong>raising your cumulative GPA by the end of the Summer Session 2 quarter</strong>? Here are the rules for the SS2 pool:
          <ol>
            <li>The minimum buy-in fee for the Summer Session 2 pool is <strong>$20</strong> and the maximum you can commit is <strong>$100</strong>. If you fail to raise your cumulative GPA by the end of the SS2 quarter, you will forfeit your buy-in fee. If you succeed, you will split the pot of buy-in fees proportionally based on your buy-in fee, with all other students who also successfully raised their cumulative GPAs.  For instance, if you commit $40, your winning share will be twice as large as those who commit $20. Note that the worst outcome that can happen should you successfully achieve the goal is that you get your money back.</li>
            <li>You must be taking 4 or more units toward a letter grade in the SS2 quarter.</li> 
            <li>You must have been enrolled at UC Davis for at least one quarter prior to the SS2 Quarter.</li>
           
          </ol>

          <strong>Important Note:</strong> We are still in the research and development phase of CollegeBetter. We also face several budget constraints. Thus, we may not be able to accept everyone who applies. Depending on interest, we may have to implement a randomization mechanism. Once the pool closes, we will notify all participants who completed the entry form below and submitted the buy-in fee whether they received a spot in the pool. Of course, students who were not randomly selected will receive their buy-in fee back.
