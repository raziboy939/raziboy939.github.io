        <span class="item2center">Are you a UC Davis undergraduate committed to the goal of <strong>raising your cumulative GPA by the end of the spring 2015 quarter</strong>? Here are the rules for the Spring 2015 pool:
          <ol>
            <li>The buy-in fee for the Spring 2015 pool is <strong>$10</strong>, and will be collected via PayPal. If you fail to raise your cumulative GPA by the end of the Spring 2015 quarter, you will forfeit your $10 buy-in. If you succeed, you will split the giant pot of buy-in fees with all other students who also successfully raised their cumulative GPAs. Note that the worst outcome that can happen should you successfully achieve the goal is that you get your money back.</li>
            <li>You must be taking 12 or more units toward a letter grade in the Spring 2015 quarter.</li> 
            <li>You must have been enrolled at UC Davis for at least one quarter prior to the Spring 2015 Quarter.</li>
            <li>You must order an official academic transcript, which we will use to verify everyone’s grades at end of Spring 2015 quarter. Ordering is totally free. You must order the transcript upon signing up for the pool. When you order the transcript, you can select an option that allows the transcipts to be sent at the end of the Spring 2015 quarter. <a href="spring2015-transcript.html">Here are instructions for ordering.</a></li>
          </ol>

          <strong>Important Note:</strong> Since we are still at the beginning stages of CollegeBetter and for experimental purposes, we will not be able to accept everyone. After you sign up for the Spring 2015 pool and we verify that you have ordered an official transcript, we will notify you about whether you were selected to participate, and provide instructions about submitting the $10 buy-in via PayPal.
