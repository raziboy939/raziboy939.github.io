            <h3>University  of  Hawai'i  Consent  to  Participate  in  a  Research  Project</h3>
              <h4>Lester  Lusher,  Principal  Investigator  </h4>

           <strong><p> College  Better:  Parimutuel  Betting  Markets  as  a  Commitment  Device  and  Monetary  Incentive</p></strong>

            <p>Aloha! My name is Lester Lusher and you are invited to take part in a research study. I am a professor at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa in the Department of Economics. The purpose of my project is to evaluate the effectiveness of an online program called “CollegeBetter.” No more than 3,000 students will join the study.
            </p>

              <p>CollegeBetter is a program that I designed to learn if money motivates students to raise their cumulative GPAs by the end of the semester. The CollegeBetter program is conducted entirely online through the website www.collegebetter.com. If you choose to participate in this research project, you will sign up online through the website www.collegebetter.com. I am asking you to participate because you are an undergraduate at UH Mānoa taking 10 or more credits toward a letter grade in the Fall/Spring/Summer 2018-2020 semester. Participants must have been enrolled at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa for at least one semester prior to the Fall/Spring/Summer 2018-2020. All undergraduate students at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa are invited to participate in this research study, regardless of discipline.

            </p>

            <p><strong>Activities and Time Commitment:</strong> If you participate in this project, after the consent process and if you agree to participate, here is what you will do:


            </p>

            <ul>
              <li> Register on the CollegeBetter.com website by clicking “Join a pool” for the term of interest. The registration page will ask you questions like “What is your student ID number” and “What is your full name”. </li>

              <li>Submit the buy-in fee for the Fall/Spring/Summer 2018-2020 pool which will be around $20 and will be collected via Venmo or PayPal. These buy-in fees are collected into one pot.</li>

             <li> If participants do not raise their cumulative GPA by the end of the Fall/Spring/Summer 2018-2020, they will not get their buy-in money back. </li>

              <li>If participants raise their cumulative GPA by the end of the Fall/Spring/Summer 2018-2020, participants will be given their portion of all the money submitted in the buy-in fee divided evenly between students who raise their GPA.</li>

              <li>The only criterion for raising cumulative GPA is getting a semester GPA that exceeds the cumulative GPA the student had entering the term (even if, due to rounding, the cumulative GPA did not end up "changing"). </li>

              <li>All participants who raise their GPA by the end of the semester will at least get their buy-in money back with the possibility of more depending upon how successful everyone in the pool is with raising their GPA.</li>

              <li>Participants will be asked to submit their electronic signature so that I can directly access their university transcript to see the participant’s cumulative GPA. I will also have permission from the university to directly access student transcripts for this project.</li>

            </ul>

            <p>I may not be able to accept everyone who wants to participate because there is a limit to the number of participants.
            </p>

           <p><strong> Benefits and Risks:</strong> There will be no direct benefit to you for participating in this research project. The results of this project may help researchers like me understand what motivates students to increase their GPA, specifically, if money is an effective incentive. I believe there is little risk to you for participating in this research project. You may experience disappointment and/or emotional distress if you were not able to raise your GPA by the end of the semester and consequently receive a portion of the buy-in amount. The Counseling and Student Development Center is available to provide counseling support to students at the Queen Liliʻuokalani Center for Student Services, Room 312, Phone: (808) 956-7927.</p>

            <p><strong>Privacy and Confidentiality: </strong>I will strip and de-identify data upon collection of participant transcripts. All data storage will be on a secure server stored in a room that only I, Lester Lusher, will have access to. There will be no link the participant responses or grades to the actual student. Other agencies that have legal permission have the right to review research records. The University of Hawai'i Human Studies Program has the right to review research records for this study. </p>

          <p>Participants will give the researchers an electronic signature that will provide permission to access their transcripts directly from the university, instead of requesting a paper copy. When I report the results of my research project, I will not use your name. I will not use any other personal identifying information that can identify you. I will use pseudonyms (fake names) and report my findings in a way that protects your privacy and confidentiality to the extent allowed by law.  </p>

          <p><strong>Voluntary Participation: </strong>Your participation in this project is completely voluntary. You may stop participating at any time. Your choice to participate or not participate will not affect your grades, class standing, or relationship with the University. Participants who choose to withdraw will receive a full refund of their buy-in money if they withdraw by [enter date, likely to be the last day students can drop their classes]. If the project has begun, participants can still withdraw themselves from the study but will not get their buy-in fee back.  </p>

         <p> <strong>Questions:</strong>  If you have any questions about this study, please call or email me, Lester Lusher at 5109385223 and lrlusher@hawaii.edu or support@collegebetter.com.</p> 

         <p> You may contact the UH Human Studies Program at 808.956.5007 or uhirb@hawaii.edu to discuss problems, concerns and questions; obtain information; or offer input with an informed individual who is unaffiliated with the specific research protocol. Please visit https://www,hawaii.edu/researchcompliance/information-research-participants for more information on your rights as a research participant. </p>

          Please keep a copy of this consent form for your records and reference.
